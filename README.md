This is a keyboard for Windows with [X compose key](https://cgit.freedesktop.org/xorg/lib/libX11/plain/nls/en_US.UTF-8/Compose.pre)-style AltGr combinations built in. Painstakingly created because I had to use Windows for a while and couldn't live without shortcuts for ellipses and em dashes. 

[This page](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ComposeKey) lists common key combinations, most of which work with this layout.

To edit this keyboard layout yourself, you'll need [Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator 1.4](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=22339) and [.NET Framework 2.0](https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/download/details.aspx?id=6523).
