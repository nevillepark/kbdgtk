# kbdgtk

This is a keyboard for Windows with [GTK compose key](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ComposeKey)-style AltGr combinations built in. Painstakingly created because I had to use Windows for a while and couldn't live without shortcuts for ellipses and em dashes. 

[The GTK compose table](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ComposeKey) lists key combinations, most of which work with this layout.

To edit this keyboard layout yourself, you'll need [Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator 1.4](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=22339) and [.NET Framework 2.0](https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/download/details.aspx?id=6523).
